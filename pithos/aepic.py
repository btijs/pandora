    Summary AEPIC: check that all *reads* are 8-byte aligned and size <=8 (ie 2/4/8):
    - "Note that naturally aligned 8-byte loads are not affected by this behavior"
    - "reads data from outside the enclaveâ€™s ELRANGE at a size and alignment of [minimum] 8 bytes"
    - this seems to be an instance of Shared Buffers Data Read (SBDR): "In processors affected by SBDR, any read that is wider than 4 bytes could potentially have stale data returned from a transaction buffer."

    Summary MMIO stale data:
    - "all *writes* to untrusted memory must either be preceded by the VERW instruction and followed by the MFENCE; LFENCE instruction sequence or must be in multiples of 8 bytes [so def not smaller! -- DRPW], aligned to an 8-byte boundary"
    - "An MFENCE;LFENCE sequence or a serializing instruction after the write can ensure that younger operations that touch secret data do not put that data into a fill buffer entry before the older write uses that fill buffer entry."

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #1 modify `memcpy/memset/memmv/etc` simprocedure optimization:
        1. catch all functions that have `memcpy` in the name
        2. done. make sure src and dst are entirely inside enclave
            2.1 yes: proceed with the simprocedure (fast path)
            2.2 no: proceed with the assembly (slow path)

    #2 for every *untrusted* memory access check:
        1. done reads (AEPIC, SBDR): always 8-byte aligned and size in [1,2,4,8]
        2. writes (DRPW): check either
            * 8-byte aligned and size in [8,16,32,64]; or
            * disassembly and check preceded directly by `VERW` and directly followed by a pair `LFENCE; MFENCE`, then downgrade severity to debug
