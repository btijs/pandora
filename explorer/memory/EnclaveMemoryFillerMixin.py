    """
    The EnclaveMemoryFillerMixin makes sure that default memory behaves differently depending
    on which address it has.

    Enclave Memory:
     - Measured pages: Are treated as zero
     - Unmeasured pages: Are treated as attacker controlled
    Non-enclave memory:
     - Treated as attacker controlled

    Note that this mixin should only be called on addresses UNKNOWN to the memory backend, so any data
     loaded during Pandora loading should already be returned before this is called. This is just the last
     resort if angr can't resolve the address.
